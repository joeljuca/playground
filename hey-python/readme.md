# Hey, Python!

This is literally my "Hello, World in Python." Here I'm mostly concerned about understand Python strengths, its modularization system, techniques, and best practices - as well as playing with it by writing some random and fun code.

## Set up

It uses Python's built-in [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module for virtual environments. You can set it up with:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate it with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The whole virtual environment will be loaded in your shell (and `$PATH`), including the Python runtime, PIP, and everything else.

Deactivate it (exit the virtual environment) with:

```bash
deactivate
```
